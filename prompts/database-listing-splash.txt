Go into plan mode.  ContentView is used to draw the list of Databases that the end user can select from or register a new database connection.  I would like to make this more attractive like the Xcode starting project window.  You can see an example of this in the screenshot  xcode-project-list.png.  On the left it has a logo and image with the buttons below it to create a new project, clone a repo, or open an existing project.  On the right side it has a listing of projects with the one the mouse has selected highlighted.

I would like our ContentView to look similar to this.  On the left I would like to have an attractive image of the Ditto logo.  I have an image from the marketing team called ditto-splash.png in the screens folder.  I would like to see how we can use this for the left side.  I would like below the Ditto logo for it to say Edge Studio - so the image would need to be the background and then the text would draw over it.  Edge Studio should be in the brand color Yello and it needs to use the font Chakra Petch which is the font from our brand guidelines.  I guess this is available via Google Fonts.

Below Edge Studio like on the Xcode Screen where it has the button to create a new project - we should have the button for registering a database with text stating register database.  On the right side we need to list the existing databases, this is the database listing.  We need to change this so that we only show the name and the databaseId, but like the current cards we have to not show the databaseId unless someone clicks on it.  Double clicking on the database listing would open it.  Right clicking on it would give the options to edit or delete.  They shouldn't look like cards anymore, instead they should look like the project listing in Xcode.  Like with the XCode project listing you should be able to scroll it if there are more project listings than fits on the window size.  

 The ContentView window size can be decreased to be around the size of XCode's size, however when the MainStudioView appears - it should be larger - the current size it is.   Create a plan on how the UI can be updated for this.
