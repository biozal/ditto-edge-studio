Go into plan mode again.  observeDetailView in DetailView.swift has the same problems that queryDetailView had before we fixed it which is using a VSplitView which causes issues when both the Sidebar and Inspector views are open at the same time.  Because of this I would like to completely refactor this so that it uses the same patterns that we did in queryDetailView.  Research the fixes we put in to keep queryDetailView working with showing a top part and bottom part and make a plan to update observerDetailView to use the same technique.  Also the message for No Observer Selected and having a separate view for this vs the SplitView isn't needed - just draw that in the top view.  

Once you have a plan for accomplishing this let me know so I can review.  Part of this clean up is we should have less code that detects IOS vs Mac since we had the ios detection code because iPadOS doesn't support VSplitView.  So as part of this clean up we should look at that code and see if there is parts we can remove and simplify the code base for both queryDetailView and observeDetailView.  The next phase after this phase is to look at iPad again and get all the UI working for it so this will put us ahead on that topic.
