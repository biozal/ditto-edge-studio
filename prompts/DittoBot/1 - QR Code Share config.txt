Go into plan mode.  Now that Ditto Edge Studio runs on both MacOS and iPad OS I would like the ability to import the configuration from MacOS to iPadOS so I don't have to type.  

What I would like to do is in MacOS specifically right click on a registered database from the database listing and have the option for QR Code.  When this happens a QR Code is generated of the database configuration and displayed on the screen.

This would need to be a swipe option on the databse listing where if they swipe we give them the option to edit or delete there would be a new option for QR Code.  This would generate the QR Code and show it on the screen.

I would like do then on the database listing screen have the ability to import from QR Code as a new option on all platforms.  When this happens the camera comes up so you can scan in the QR Code.  

Once the QR Code is scanned in we should give them a spinner while we load the configuration into the database and update the database listing.  We should bring in the configuration EXACTLY like it is on the other device.

For iPadOS/iOS when the screen is taller than wider, this would be a QR Code icon button on the toolbar to import in the configuration.  

Research options for allowing this feature.
